0: 16 - Ive been running the bingo here at the Boyle center on Thursdays since 2006. 

0:23 - My friend Celia Wilson she was my caller before Kenny, she got ill ended up in hospital and she passed on. And i know i just was beside myself from there because..  

0:44 - Excuse me, we were friends for over 30 years and so when i asked Kenny I said "Would you pelase help me, I need a caller" he said sure.

1:00 - ("Hey are we ready to play Bingo" - Kenny) And he started calling bingo for me and he's been calling ever since. 

1:10 - The main thing is they enjoyed themselves calling bingo and they get so excited when they're waiting. You know you see some of them turn around and  they want me to read their lips and I can't do that because whatever comes onto that chute is what they're going to get.

1:40 They don't make much they only win six dollars when it comes to being paid; it makes them quite happy to win that amount of money becuase they don't play professionally in other places they just play here at the Boyle Center.

1:57 - The bingo it keeps you your mind activated enough to keep it going it doesn't get like dry or stale. You got to do things that will make your mind be activated and I find that to be so.  Bingo,  its the thrill of saying "Bingo" actually $6.00 is minual but we love it. I mean even we're playing not because the money,  for the enjoyments you know what I'm saying and it helps us a lot intellectually really so I mean the money means nothing it's just being
together you know. 

2:42 - Well they take it very serious these older people boy they have a sure temper. I'm glad they don't have guns. 

2:59 - I play if i win tell me I have to be investigated
